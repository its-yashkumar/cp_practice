/*We will see how to apply binary search in rotated array
In a rotated array an element is taken and brought to the front
For example suppose array is 
1,2,3,4,5
after one rotation it becomes
5,1,2,3,4
after second rotation it becomes 
4,5,1,2,3 and so on*/
/*Example array for given question
5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4 : it is rotated 5 times
